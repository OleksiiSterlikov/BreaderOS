<p dir="ltr">All private WAN technologies discussed so far used either copper or fiber-optic media. What if an organization needed connectivity in a remote location where there are no service providers that offer WAN service?</p><p dir="ltr">Very small aperture terminal (VSAT) is a solution that creates a private WAN using satellite communications. A VSAT is a small satellite dish similar to those used for home Internet and TV. VSATs create a private WAN while providing connectivity to remote locations.</p><p dir="ltr">Specifically, a router connects to a satellite dish which is pointed to a service provider’s satellite. This satellite is in geosynchronous orbit in space. The signals must travel approximately 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles) to the satellite and back.</p><p dir="ltr">The example in the figure displays a VSAT dish on the roofs of the buildings communicating with a satellite thousands of kilometers away in space.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="data/1.2.2.8.jpg" alt="1.2.2.8" width="958" height="658" class="atto_image_button_text-bottom"><br></p>
