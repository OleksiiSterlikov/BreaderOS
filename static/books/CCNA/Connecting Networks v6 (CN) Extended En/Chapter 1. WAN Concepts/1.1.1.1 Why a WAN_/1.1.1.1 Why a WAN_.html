<p dir="ltr">A WAN operates beyond the geographic scope of a LAN. As shown in the figure, WANs are used to interconnect the enterprise LAN to remote LANs in branch sites and telecommuter sites.</p><p dir="ltr">A WAN is owned by a service provider. An organization must pay a fee to use the provider’s network services to connect remote sites. WAN service providers include carriers, such as a telephone network, cable company, or satellite service. Service providers provide links to interconnect remote sites for the purpose of transporting data, voice, and video.</p><p dir="ltr">In contrast, LANs are typically owned by an organization and used to connect local computers, peripherals, and other devices within a single building or other small geographic area.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="data/1.1.1.1.jpg" alt="1.1.1.1" width="958" height="658" class="atto_image_button_text-bottom"><br></p>
